# twisted-colorful-sphere

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-r3f-app`](https://github.com/RenaudROHLINGER/create-r3f-app)

Learn how to deform and color a sphere to create an interesting animation with Three.js.

Thanks to [`Mario Carrillo`](https://marioecg.com/) and his [`tutorial`](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2021/01/26/twisted-colorful-spheres-with-three-js/).

In this repo, I converted the JS/Three codebase to a React/React-Three-Fiber implementation with hook and add an extra option in the settings panel to enable/disable wireframe props on the shader material.
